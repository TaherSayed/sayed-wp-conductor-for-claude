# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest minor release receives security fixes. Older releases are not patched.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email **open a private security advisory on https://github.com/TaherSayed/sayed-wp-conductor-for-claude/security/advisories** rather than opening a public issue.

Please include:

1. A description of the vulnerability and its impact (data exposure, privilege escalation, DoS, etc.).
2. Steps to reproduce, ideally with a proof-of-concept.
3. Affected versions you've tested.
4. Your environment (WordPress version, PHP version, hosting / proxy).

You will get an acknowledgement within **72 hours** and a fix-or-mitigation plan within **7 days** for confirmed issues.

## Coordinated disclosure

We follow a standard 90-day coordinated-disclosure timeline. If you intend to publish or present the finding, please coordinate the release date with us so users have time to upgrade.
